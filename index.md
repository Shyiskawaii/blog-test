This is a step-to-step tutorial to install AstroDX (*MaiMai clone*) and it also help you import charts from a private project so **please do not share this link**.
~~Im just trying out the markdown lol~~
~~And im shy af so dont~~

### Step 1: Install AstroDX on your Android phone  

- Go to [this link](https://github.com/2394425147/maipaddx/releases).
- Find the latest v2.0 build and download the APK.
- Open the APK on your phone.
- Run AstroDX once to set up for step 2.

### Step 2: Importing chart
> You can do this step on Mobile only but i recommend using PC to help with the importing. 

- Head to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NiZ9rL19qKLqt0uNcP5tIqc0fUrksAPs) and download the charts there.
- Now connect your Phone to your PC via your charging cable.
- Open your phone internal storage and go find `Android/Data/`.
- The will be a file called `/com.Reflektone.AstroDX/` there (if not then you need to open AstroDX so it can be set up).
- Copy the chart you have downloaded and paste it in `Android/Data/com.Reflektone.AstroDX/files/levels`.

### Step 3: Setting up
Because AstroDX v2.0 is really unstable so you need to know these setting to make the game enjoyable.
- In the Metrics tab, you can change Judgement visibility and Early/Late visibility to make the gameplay cleaner.
- In the Gameplay tab, Tap speed is how fast note approach the judgement line so if you see the note too fast you can increase and decrease if too slow.   
- Charts in AstroDX is **miss time** due to various reason and it often annoying to change the offset on almost every charts. 

1. To change the map offset, You can pause the map and press `<<` if the first beat come after the note or `>>` if the first beat come before the first note and the press `Retry`.
2. Repeat step 1 until you hear the note sync with the music. **Tips:** The offset is measure in seconds so if it off by like a second you should change the offset value by 1.00. But the offset is really small, consider changing it by 0.10-0.30 at a time. In case you don't know if it late or early then you can play the map a bit and only tap to the music, then you can see the Early/Late when you hit Great and Good      
3. It can be tricky as first but when you got used to it you can change offset in no time and it also save everytime you do it so you don't have to do it again.
